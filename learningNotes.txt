The above set of code is a representation of how to trigger the digest loop in Angular especially within a callback.

The error caused when not using $scope.$apply was due to the fact that the click even would execute the function, but would not execute
the change in url in the call back because the digest loop had already made its turn. When clicked again the loop would register the
change in url.

When adding $scope.$apply, we are forcing the digest loop to turn once the callback fires.


... That being said, using scope and the promisified auth by firebase seems to work around by binding to the $scope.
